Finding 2D Steady State Heat Distribution with Parallel Programming
-------------------------
This project experiment OpenMP and MPI programming for computing and finding 2D Steady State Heat Distribution.

This assignment work is done for COMP90025 Project 2 assessment 2016 SM2, The University of Melbourne. You can read [the report](SanKhoLin_GuangHu_COMP90025_Project2_Report.pdf). The implementation still has room for improvement. You may wish to cite this work as follow.
